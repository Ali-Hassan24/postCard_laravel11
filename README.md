## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Running the Project

After cloning the repository, follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### 2. Install dependencies:
Make sure [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is installed on your system, then run:
```bash
composer install
```

### 3. Copy `.env` file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 4. Generate the application key:
```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### 5. Configure environment variables:
Open the `.env` file and update the following details according to your environment:
- Database connection (`DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`, etc.)
- Other services if needed (e.g., mail, storage, etc.)

### 6. Run migrations:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 7. Link the storage:
To make your storage accessible via the public directory:
```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

### 8. Install NPM dependencies (if using frontend assets like Vue or Tailwind CSS):
Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) are installed on your system, then run:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 9. Start the local development server:
```bash
php artisan serve
```

The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.
